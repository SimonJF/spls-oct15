	<li><h4>11:00 - 11:45: James Chapman -- Title TBD</h4></li>
	<li><h4>11:45 - 12:30: Aaron Crane -- Writing immutable software in a mutable language</h4>
		<p>
			<blockquote>
Languages like Haskell and Idris view immutability of data as a
property of the language. Proponents of this approach point out
advantages like the ease of reasoning about program behaviour,
especially for data that is used across concurrency boundaries.<br /> <br />

This talk offers an alternative view of the world: that software
designs can get huge benefit from relying on immutable data even when
the implementation uses a language designed around mutable data. While
this is not an entirely novel position, it is backed up here by a case
study of a piece of real-world industrial software, written in Perl,
that extracts rich information from web pages published by the
Scottish and UK parliaments. Perl is a highly dynamic language; it
strongly favours the flexibility and convenience offered by that
approach over both theoretical purity and the ability to make static
guarantees about program behaviour. This talk examines how the design
of the Cutbot software makes the most of both mutable and immutable
data — even in the absence of language support for guaranteeing
immutability. </blockquote></p>

	<li><h4>14:00 - 14:30: Guillaume Allais -- Type and Scope Preserving Semantics</h4>
	<p><blockquote>We introduce a notion of type and scope preserving semantics generalising Goguen
and McKinna’s approach to defining one traversal generic enoughto be instantiated
to renaming first and then substitution. Its careful distinctionof environment and
model values as well as its variation on a structure typicalof a Kripke semantics
make it capable of expressing renaming and substitutionbut also various forms of
Normalisation by Evaluation as well as, perhaps moresurprisingly, monadic computations
such as a printing function. <br />  <br />
We then demonstrate that expressing these algorithms in a common frameworkyields
immediate benefits: we can deploy some logical relations generically overthese
instances and obtain for instance the fusion lemmas for renaming, substitution
and normalisation by evaluation as simple corollaries of the appropriatefundamental
lemma. </blockquote></p></li>

<ul>
	<li><h4>16:30 - 17:00: Charles Grellois -- Linear logic, duality, and higher-order model-checking</h4>
	<p><blockquote>
A common approach in verification, model-checking consists in computing whether a given formula holds on an abstract model of interest -- typically, on a tree of actions representing the set of executions of a program. Over such a tree, a common procedure is to execute an automaton which checks whether an associated formula is satisfied. <br /> <br />

The model-checking of functional programs requires a careful treatment of higher-order recursive computation, which is a major hurdle to the traditional abstraction of programs as finite graphs, and thus to a decidability result. This led to the use of semantic methods, notably in Ong's decidability proof (2006). <br /> <br />

In this talk, we explain how linear logic leads to a new insight into the higher-order model-checking problem, notably as it discloses very naturally the dual behavior of the program and of its automata-theoretic specification. From this observation, we extend models of linear logic to obtain a purely semantic account of Ong's result: a given property over the set of executions of the program is satisfied if and only if the semantic interaction of the program with the automaton encoding the property of interest contains the initial state of the automaton. <br /> <br />

This is joint work with my PhD advisor Paul-André Melliès.</blockquote></p></li>
